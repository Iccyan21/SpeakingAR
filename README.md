# 💬 Overview

This app automatically translates what someone says in English and uses AI to suggest the most natural reply.
It also shows the katakana pronunciation of the suggested English sentence, so even if you’re not confident in English, you can respond right away.

The focus isn’t just on understanding English — it’s on actually responding to it.

※ You only need your own OpenAI API key to use the app.

# 🎙️ How to Use

Press and hold the record button to capture the other person’s English speech.

Once recording is finished, the following information will automatically appear:

　🗣️ The English phrase that was spoken
　💬 Its meaning in Japanese
　🤖 AI-generated “recommended reply”
　🔈 Katakana pronunciation guide for the reply

Keep the button pressed to continue real-time conversation.

# 🖼️ Example
Speaker: Hello, nice to meet you  

Meaning: こんにちは、はじめまして。  

Suggested Reply:
Hey, that’s nice to hear!  
→ それを聞いて嬉しいよ！

Pronunciation:
ヘイ、ザッツ ナイス トゥ ヒア！


Just by listening to the other person’s words,
you instantly get the meaning → reply → pronunciation flow — all automatically generated.
